ScheduleSmart
ScheduleSmart is a comprehensive scheduling application designed to help users manage their daily activities efficiently. It features an integrated chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, providing real-time scheduling suggestions and modifications for an enhanced user experience. The app includes responsive calendar views (day, week, month) and uses Core Data for persistent storage of user events and preferences.

Features
Interactive Calendar Views: Day, week, and month views for easy navigation and event management.
Integrated Chatbot: Real-time scheduling suggestions and modifications.
Persistent Storage: Core Data integration for storing user events and preferences.
Event Creation and Management: Easily add, edit, and delete events.
Real-Time Updates: Live updates to the schedule with real-time time indicators.
Inspiration
The inspiration for ScheduleSmart came from the need for a more intuitive and intelligent scheduling application. By integrating a chatbot, we aimed to provide users with real-time assistance in managing their schedules, ensuring they make the most out of their day with minimal wasted time.

What We Learned
During the development of ScheduleSmart, we gained valuable experience in integrating third-party APIs, working with Core Data for persistent storage, and designing intuitive user interfaces with SwiftUI. We also learned how to implement real-time features and handle data synchronization across different sessions.

How We Built ScheduleSmart
Frontend: Developed using SwiftUI, providing a modern and responsive user interface.
Backend: Utilized Core Data for data storage and EventKit for event management.
Chatbot Integration: Integrated OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for real-time scheduling suggestions and modifications.
Testing: Implemented thorough testing for both the frontend and backend to ensure robustness and reliability.
Challenges We Faced
Data Synchronization: Ensuring data integrity and seamless synchronization across different sessions was a significant challenge.
Real-Time Features: Implementing real-time updates and live time indicators required careful consideration and optimization.
API Integration: Integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and managing API calls effectively.
What's Next for ScheduleSmart
We plan to enhance ScheduleSmart by further improving the chatbot's capabilities to optimally edit schedules, add or remove events on the fly, and suggest event timings based on location and user preferences. Our goal is to make the scheduling experience even more seamless and efficient.
